# 1. What is SquareIt?

It is a game that is designed for 11- to 14-year-olds. The user will log in to the website and with their account they will be able to play with their school friends, random players online or bots. The user can select the year they are in and the courses they would like to learn in which they will be given a piece of text and a video explaining the content. After clicking a button acknowledging the user has read the content, they will be asked to test their knowledge with a SquareIt. A SquareIt is a game where users can go against each other for up to 3 minutes depending on the course with either 2 players or 4 players. When playing the game, a titled square will appear on the screen with a timer and the players will be given a random single set of questions to answer as quickly as possible. Each player will be given an equal part of the square which will be coloured their colour and if a question is answered correctly, a single tile of the all opposition squares will be coloured their colour. If the user gets the question wrong the tile will remain the same and the player who answered the question the quickiest will get a single tile of the oppositions tile. If there is a title of the opposions colour on your part of the sqaure the only way to take it back is by answering the question as quick as possible. The player will be able to type there answer in and the questions will be designed to be fill the gaps or short answer questions. The website will detect if certain words are included in the short answer to determine if the answer is correct and if the player makes a spelling mistake the answer will be incorrect. The game aims to answer as many questions as quickly as possible to gain territory on the square and if the player's square is completely covered in their colour, they win the game. When playing against 4 people, if one of the player's squares is covered, they will be kicked out. If the round has ended and the players have an equal percentage of squares in the game it will be a tie and they can move on to the next level or play again. The winner will be determined by who has the most points in the SquareIt level.
There will be three levels of SquareIt in each lesson on the course because they will help users better understand and keep knowledge of the lessons. Each time the user plays SquareIt, they will be given a mixed set of questions in the game so that no SquareIt questions can be memorised in a particular order. The levels of SquareIt will increase in level of difficulty based on the lesson content.  For each question correct they will receive a point out of 5 based on how quickly the question was answered and the player will get 0 points if the question is incorrect. You will give bronze silver and gold badges per lesson and if you collect all the badges on the course, you will receive a Super-Badge along with a digital certificate. There will be an overall leaderboard on the main page which will show the score of the people you have played on SquareIt. You will also be able to add friends to play against each other and you will be able to join groups if learning with a school. If a player is on a streak and secures 3 tiles of each oppositions squares without another player answering a question before them, a fire emoji will appear on that players screen and the same will happen for 5 titles.
SquareIt caters for individuals with disabilities by having screen readers for the visually impaired and subtitles for the hearing impaired. The website supports multiple languages to enhance communication for user friendliness and inclusivity which also helps broaden the users of SquareIt. There will also be an optional feedback button which will help better create questions for the course.
